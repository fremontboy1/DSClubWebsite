            The club hosts two different kinds of data fests: micro data fests and data fests. The first
            ones are held more often and are basically just a shorter version of a data fest. Typically, 
            45 minutes are given to teams of 4 (we make sure each team has a variety of skill levels in it)
            to solve a real-world like problem. Each member of the team that wins gets a prize!
